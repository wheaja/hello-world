Practice work
My name is James Charles Whear. I am originally from Liberia, West Africa. I am working as a Registered Nurse at United Hospital. I am looking forward to learning new things to add onto my CV and to also make myself versatile in this ever-evolving world. I am a novice to computer programming but I can learn once I commit myself.
It's good to be here.
